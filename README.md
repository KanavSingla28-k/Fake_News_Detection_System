## Overview

This project aims to build a **Fake News Detection System**.  
It uses text-based features (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, N-grams) and trains classical machine learning classifiers (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**.

---

## Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal)  
- Feature extraction:  
  - Bag of Words  
  - TF-IDF  
  - N-grams  
- Multiple classification models  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)  

---

## Architecture / Workflow

1. **Data Load & Preprocess**  
   - Read raw text  
   - Clean (remove punctuation, lowercasing, etc.)  
   - Tokenize & remove stopwords  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create numerical vectors (BoW, TF-IDF, N-grams)  
3. **Model Training & Tuning**  
   - Train Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.  
   - Tune hyperparameters  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Use held-out test set  
   - Report metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1  
5. **Inference / Prediction**  
   - Given new text, preprocess â†’ extract features â†’ predict class
